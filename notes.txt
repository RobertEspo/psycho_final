LITERATURE REVIEW

Theoretical framework
	Language processing is incremental and predictive (Altmann & Kamide, 1999; Kutas & Federmeier, 2011; Pickering & Garrod, 2013). Is prosodic information integrated as they unfold, or retrospectively?
	Prosodic cues to sentence modality in Spanish (Face 2007).
	English cues. They primarily use word order changes, so maybe pay less attention to prosody. Reduced efficiency in predictive processing in L2.
